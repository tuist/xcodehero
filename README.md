`xcodehero` is a CLI that was developed for the talk "Building Swift CLIs that your users and contributors love" at [Swift Heroes 2024](https://swiftheroes.com/2024/agenda/).
The tool wraps the `xcodebuild` command to improve its interface and make it easier to use. The presentation walks the audience through the process of building the tool, from the initial idea to the final implementation, teaching how to build a CLI in Swift and how to make it user-friendly.

## Set up for development
